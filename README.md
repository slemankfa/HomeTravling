# Home Traveling

Welcome to my little development world, where I spend some time to sharp and improving my coding skills. ^^

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter TDD Clean Architecture application.


I have added 3 features [fetch_countries,fetch_cities and get_activites] with all testing units almost related to them, in addition, tried to get used to writing unit testing all the time.

This project supports Android, IOS and Web at the same time and currently, the UI is ready for mobile, however, it will work on the web but will not be responsive as we wish, will work at this point in the future.

After all, this is my first open-source project and I’m quite sure it’s not perfect but I will do my best in future releases, in addition, I hope I didn’t forget anything.

I am always eager to learn and I’m sure there are many so I am happy to take this first step and share my knowledge.

Without further ado, that's all for the first release. ^^
